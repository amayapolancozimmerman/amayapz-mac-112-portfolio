-   Why data visualization is beneficial:

    -   Provides a sense of scale and typical outcomes

    -   Provides information about typical outliers

    -   Provides an understanding of patterns and relationships between variables

    -   Informs the next step of our analysisÂ 

    -   Prompts us to refine our investigative question

    -   Supports and communicates findings gained by analyzing data

-   Data visualization is the process of mapping data to different plot components

-   Mapping components in data visualization:

1.  A frame or coordinate system -- variables /features that define the axes and gridlines of the canvas

2.  A layer -- geometric elements (such as lines and/or points) added to the canvas to represent the data or patterns in the data

    1.  Each geometric element is a separate layer and there can be many

3.  Scales -- geometric elements can tell us more about the potential scaling and grouping of data

4.  Faceting -- splitting of data into multiple subplots to examine different groups within the data

5.  Theme -- additional controls relating to the aesthetics of the plot
