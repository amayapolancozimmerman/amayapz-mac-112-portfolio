You want to be able to look back on your work and know what you were thinking /doing at past moments, and you also want others to be able to look at your work and know what you were doing. Leaving comments on your work is good for communication."

    "text": "Why data visualization is beneficial:\n\nProvides a sense of scale and typical outcomes\nProvides information about typical outliers\nProvides an understanding of patterns and relationships between variables\nInforms the next step of our analysis\nPrompts us to refine our investigative question\nSupports and communicates findings gained by analyzing data\n\nData visualization is the process of mapping data to different plot components\nMapping components in data visualization: (1) A frame or coordinate system – variables /features that define the axes and gridlines of the canvas (2) A layer: geometric elements (such as lines and/or points) added to the canvas to represent the data or patterns in the data - Each geometric element is a separate layer and there can be many (3) Scales: geometric elements can tell us more about the potential scaling and grouping of data (4) Faceting: splitting of data into multiple subplots to examine different groups within the data (5) Theme: additional controls relating to the aesthetics of the plot\n“gg” = grammar of graphics"
