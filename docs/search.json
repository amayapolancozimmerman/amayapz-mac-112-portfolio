    "text": "The intention behind data science is to use data to understand information relating to a specific field of study and question, within a specific and defined context. Within RStudio we have access to a console (for quick calculations and testing code), our console history to access previous work, as well as files and plot packages to support our endeavors on R. Quarto is a technological tool incorporated into RStudio to enable the reproducible creation of nicely formatted documents, webpages, etc. It is important to leave comments (#) as you work for your own clarity and understanding, as well as for that of others. You want to be able to look back on your work and know what you were thinking /doing at past moments, and you also want others to be able to look at your work and know what you were doing. Leaving comments on your work is good for communication."

    "text": "Why data visualization is beneficial: Provides a sense of scale and typical outcomes Provides information about typical outliers Provides an understanding of patterns and relationships between variables Informs the next step of our analysis Prompts us to refine our investigative question Supports and communicates findings gained by analyzing data Data visualization is the process of mapping data to different plot components Mapping components in data visualization: A frame or coordinate system – variables /features that define the axes and gridlines of the canvas A layer – geometric elements (such as lines and/or points) added to the canvas to represent the data or patterns in the data Each geometric element is a separate layer and there can be many Scales – geometric elements can tell us more about the potential scaling and grouping of data Faceting – splitting of data into multiple subplots to examine different groups within the data Theme – additional controls relating to the aesthetics of the plot “gg” = grammar of graphics"
