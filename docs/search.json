This is likely because some of the major cities in the US are located on the coasts, and it makes sense for bigger cities to have more franchise locations. One thing that surprises me about our map is that, though California has the largest population density and some of the greatest concentrations of starbucks locations in the country, we do not see the same for Texas ‚Äì despite the fact that Texas has the second largest population density, it does not seem to have quite as many starbucks locations relative to its population. However, though the East Coast states have a lower population density, they have a lot more starbucks locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n9.1.2 Exercise 2\nIn this exercise, you are going to create a single Leaflet map of some of your favorite places!

    "text": "9.2 TidyTuesday\nTidy Tuesday is a weekly data project put on by some folks from the R Data Science community. Each week, a different data set is posted and people around the world wrangle and visualize that data. According to the organizers, ‚ÄúThe intent of Tidy Tuesday is to provide a safe and supportive forum for individuals to practice their wrangling and data visualization skills independent of drawing conclusions.‚Äù\nThe goals of this TidyTuesday are:\n\nPractice generating questions. You have to decide what to ask and how to answer it with a graphic.\nPractice identifying what viz and (eventually) wrangling tools are useful for addressing your questions.\nGet a sense of the broader data science community. Check out what people share out on X/Twitter #TidyTuesday. Maybe even share your own #TidyTuesday work on social media. Recent Mac alum Erin Franke (X/Twitter) has an inspiring account! Scrolling through, you‚Äôll notice the trajectory of her work, starting from COMP/STAT 112 to today. Very cool.\n\n\n9.2.1 Exercise 3\nGo to TidyTuesday. Pick a dataset that was posted in July, August, or September 2024. Here, include:\n\nA short (~2 sentence) written description of your data. This should include:\n\nthe original data source, ie, where did TidyTuesday get the data from?\nunits of observation, ie, what are you analyzing?, and\nthe data size, ie, how many data points do you have? how many variables are measured on each data point?.\n\nCode to import and examine the basic properties of your chosen dataset. This code must support the facts you cited in your short written description.\n\nThe data set I chose is about encounters with southern resident orcas in the Pacific Northwest‚Äôs Salish Sea. The data comes from the Center for Whale Research (CWR) and the units of observation are recorded encounters with orcas by CWR researchers. The data set contains 775 observations, with 19 variables being measured on each data point.\n\norcas <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-10-15/orcas.csv')\n\nRows: 775 Columns: 19\n‚îÄ‚îÄ Column specification ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (10): encounter_sequence, duration, vessel, observers, pods_or_ecotype,...\ndbl   (6): year, encounter_number, begin_latitude, begin_longitude, end_lati...\ndate  (1): date\ntime  (2): begin_time, end_time\n\n‚Ñπ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\n‚Ñπ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\ndim(orcas)\n\n[1] 775  19\n\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Exercise 4\nIn the 3 sections below (Viz 1, 2, 3), construct 3 separate graphs that tell a connected story about the data you chose.\nBefore each viz:\n\nwrite a simple but specific research question you‚Äôre trying to address with the viz.\nwrite a 2-4 sentence summary of what you learn from the viz.¬†This should connect back to your research question!\n\nAfter each viz:\n\nComment on at least 2 effective aspects of the viz (consider the effective visualization principles).\nComment on at least 2 aspects of the visualization that could be improved. Perhaps these are aspects that you don‚Äôt know how to implement yet but wish you could update it.\n\nMake sure each viz:\n\nhas meaningful axis labels and legend titles\nhas a figure caption (fig.cap)\nuses alt text (fig.alt)\nuses a more color-blind friendly color palette\n\nTips:\n\nStart with some questions in mind of what you want to learn.\nStart with a simple viz (viz 1), and build this up into something multivariate (viz 3).\nReflect on each viz ‚Äì what new questions do you have after checking out the viz?

    "text": "9 Exercise 0\nThe Birthdays dataset in the mosaic package includes information on births in the United States. Run the chunk below which wrangles this information into a new dataset, daily_births, which records the total number of births per day in the U.S. between 1969 and 1988.\nOur general goal is to understand how births vary from day to day. Let‚Äôs start by focusing on just the births variable.\nYour plots above illustrate that there‚Äôs something interesting happening here! Perhaps it can be explained by changes in birth rates over time. For example, we might wonder: Have births increased or decreased? Have there been any peaks or valleys in births? Are there any seasonal trends?\nYour above plot of births over time has an interesting pattern: there seem to be 2-3 distinct groups of points. Let‚Äôs sleuth it out.\nLet‚Äôs dig into weekly and monthly birth trends.\nIn the remaining exercises, we‚Äôll explore new data. The ‚ÄúBechdel test‚Äù tests whether movies meet the following criteria:\nIn the fivethirtyeight.com article ‚ÄúThe Dollar-And-Cents Case Against Hollywood‚Äôs Exclusion of Women‚Äù, the authors analyze which Hollywood movies do/don‚Äôt pass the test. Their data are available in the fivethirtyeight package\nRun the chunk below which wrangles this information into a new dataset, new_bechdel, which tidies up some of the categorical variables.\nThe clean_test variable goes into more detail than the binary variable. Not only does it indicate whether a film passes the test, it indicates why a failing film fails. Read more about it in the codebook.\nNOTE: The following exercise is inspired by a similar exercise by Albert Kim, a fivethirtyeight package co-author.\nThe plot in Exercise 7 illustrates that more of the films in our dataset are more recent, but it‚Äôs not easy to examine the breakdown of the Bechdel test in each 5-year period. To that end, return to the fivethirtyeight.com article (linked above and in the codebook) and examine the plot titled ‚ÄúThe Bechdel Test Over Time‚Äù.\nCongratulation üéâ.

Although there are fluctuations throughout the year, the most notable increases occur in July, August, and September. During these months, births rise to 10,000 or more. This may be related to the holidays. The overall distribution of births appears quite stable, with no significant outliers that would indicate unusual spikes or dips. The histogram supports this consistency, showing a relatively uniform spread of births across the year. However, it does have two slight peaks so I suppose we would call it bimodal, though they are so minor that I hesitate to do so. Minor variations exist throughout the plots, but they are not large enough to be considered statistically significant or particularly notable, which reaffirms the steady nature of birth rates over time."

Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday have consistently had the highest number of births across multiple decades. In contrast, Sunday has hosted the fewest births, with Saturday showing only slightly more.\nOne possible reason for this trend is the increasing prevalence of scheduled births, such as C-sections or induced labor, which might be more often planned for weekdays. I assume doctors and medical teams might avoid scheduling non-emergency procedures (including planned births) over the weekend, which could explain the drop in births on Saturdays and Sundays. Natural births, which are less predictable, likely account for the smaller number of weekend births."
