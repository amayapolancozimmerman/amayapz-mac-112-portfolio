Although there are fluctuations throughout the year, the most notable increases occur in July, August, and September. During these months, births rise to 10,000 or more. This may be related to the holidays. The overall distribution of births appears quite stable, with no significant outliers that would indicate unusual spikes or dips. The histogram supports this consistency, showing a relatively uniform spread of births across the year. However, it does have two slight peaks so I suppose we would call it bimodal, though they are so minor that I hesitate to do so. Minor variations exist throughout the plots, but they are not large enough to be considered statistically significant or particularly notable, which reaffirms the steady nature of birth rates over time.\n\n:::\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n# Exercise 3\n\nYour plots above illustrate that there's something interesting happening here! Perhaps it can be explained by changes in birth rates over *time*. For example, we might wonder: Have births increased or decreased? Have there been any peaks or valleys in births? Are there any seasonal trends?\n\n## Part a\n\nConstruct a plot of births over time. Only use 2 variables in your plot and make sure that every data point is represented in the plot (not just a summary of trends). We'll come back to this later.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='homework-2_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-8_434279507047107ef572de6f97ff6202'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(daily_births, aes(x=year, y=births))+\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](homework-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='homework-2_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-9_7201bf22a8d2a4f6d4170afc800df174'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(daily_births, aes(y =births, x =month))+\n         geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](homework-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Part b\n\nSummarize your observation about births over time. Be sure to comment on the following:\n\n-   What are the longer-term birth trends over time (on the scale of years)?\n-   Are there any seasonal trends within years (on the scale of months)?\n-   What other interesting or unusual patterns do you notice?!?\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Answer\"}\n\nRecorded birth rates reached an all-time low in 1973, while 1988 marked the highest number of births in the data provided. Over the longer term, birth rates show relative consistency, though there are small fluctuations across decades.\n\nOn a seasonal level (within years), birth rates also exhibit mild fluctuations from month to month. However, the overall range of possible birth numbers across both months and years remains quite stable, indicating a general consistency in birth trends over time.\n\nIn summary, while there are slight variations, the data suggests that birth rates tend to remain fairly steady over both long-term (yearly) and short-term (monthly) periods.\n:::\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n# Exercise 4\n\nYour above plot of births over time has an interesting pattern: there seem to be 2-3 distinct groups of points. Let's sleuth it out.\n\n## Part a\n\nStarting from your plot of births over time from above, add a new scale / variable that explains the distinction between the distinct groups. \n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Instructions\"}\n\nUse your intuition--What variables do we have that might explain the 2 groups? and play around. If you get stuck, move on to Exercise 5 and come back.\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='homework-2_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-10_e3cde94ceadd1971b0c4b2de8846908b'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(daily_births, aes(y =births, x =month))+\n         geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](homework-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='homework-2_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-11_c168f28dfabe1e5aa7b24e297160f8b1'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(daily_births, aes(y= births, x= year, color = day_of_week)) + \n  geom_point() \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](homework-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Part b\n\nExplain in words *what* is going on here (e.g. \"over time, there tend to be more births on... than on....\") and *why* you think this is happening. NOTE: The \"why\" might be challenging, so just do your best.\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Answer\"}\n\nOver time, it seems that there tend to be more births on weekdays than on weekends. Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday all seem to have hosted the most births across the span of the multiple decades. Contradistingly, Sunday seems to have hosted the fewest births across all the decades, with Saturday barely hosting just a few more. \n\n\n\nOver time, it seems that there tend to be more births on weekdays than on weekends. Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday have consistently had the highest number of births across multiple decades. In contrast, Sunday has hosted the fewest births, with Saturday showing only slightly more.\n\nOne possible reason for this trend is the increasing prevalence of scheduled births, such as C-sections or induced labor, which might be more often planned for weekdays. I assume doctors and medical teams might avoid scheduling non-emergency procedures (including planned births) over the weekend, which could explain the drop in births on Saturdays and Sundays. Natural births, which are less predictable, likely account for the smaller number of weekend births.\n\n:::\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n# Exercise 5\n\nLet's dig into weekly and monthly birth trends.\n\n## Part a\n\nConstruct 2 plots that illustrate how birth rates might vary by month, one using density plots and another using boxplots. One of these will be more useful than the other!\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='homework-2_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-12_23bef8a97e645e8908f567a79241c8d6'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(daily_births, aes(y =births, x =month))+\n         geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](homework-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='homework-2_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-13_9753826f017be9870857de7764230a51'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(daily_births, aes(y =births, x =month))+\n         geom_density()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](homework-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\nClearly, the boxplot is more useful than the density plot.\n\n## Part b\n\nConstruct a plot that illustrates how birth rates might vary by day of the week.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='homework-2_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-14_9a7786bd087766f7a070d76594ccdf0e'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(daily_births, aes(y =births, x =day_of_week))+\n         geom_boxplot()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](homework-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Part c\n\nSummarize your observations from parts a and b. Do birth rates tend to be higher in some months than others? Or higher on some days of the weeks than others? Explain. \n\n::: {.callout-important title=\"Instructions\"}\n\nIf you skipped Exercise 4, you now have the hints.\n\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Answer\"}\n\nBirthrates are higher on weekdays than they are on weekends, with Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday hosting the highest birth rates. However, birthrates across the months are essentially consistent. This is likely related to the fact that planned births are planned for weekdays because it is more operationally effective for doctors and medical staff. That said, though the specific day a procedure like a c-section occurs may be planned, no one really has any control over the month during which the baby will be ready. \n:::\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n# Exercise 6\n\nIn the remaining exercises, we'll explore new data.

However, there are a lot of outliers which indicate that some films brought in a lot of revenue despite being low budget in comparison to others. I do not see very strong evidence that a film's result on the Bechdel test will greatly impact it's box office returns or have much to do with it's budget. However, it is important to note that the film with the highest budget failed the Bechdel test and the film with that brought in the highest box office returns also failed the Bechdel test. I am inclined to say that films that fail the Bechdel test tend to do better, but the correlation is not super, super strong so I am hesitant. \n\nI also wonder if some of the high budget films might have brought in high box office returns because well-known actors or a well-known director had something to do with the film and that built a lot of anticipation for it, making people more likely to want to see it. \n\n:::\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n# Exercise 7\n\nThe `clean_test` variable goes into more detail than the `binary` variable. Not only does it indicate whether a film passes the test, it indicates *why* a failing film fails.

I am basing this off of the fact that the 'clean_test' named the category \"notalk\". However, using my external knowledge about the Bechdel test, perhaps \"notalk\" is also meant to include films in which women do have some speaking rules, but there are no instances of a woman talking to a woman about something other than a man.\n:::\n\n\\\n\n## Part c\n\nConsider two more questions: How are the films in the data set distributed across half decades, i.e. 5-year periods (`half_decades`)? And within each `half_decade`, how are the films distributed across Bechdel categories (`clean_test`)? Construct a single plot that answers both of these questions. Your y-axis should reflect *counts*, i.e. numbers of movies.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='homework-2_cache/html/unnamed-chunk-22_b9ab9186b03efcc055e5e287f11f59b5'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(new_bechdel, aes(x = half_decades, fill = clean_test)) +\n  geom_bar()+\n  labs(title= \"Bechdel Test Results Sorted By Half Decade\",\n         y= \"Number of Movies\",\n       x=\"Half Decade\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](homework-2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#How do I clean up the x axis? Each bin represents one half decade, but I don't want the x axis to list each of the years in the half decade. \n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n# Exercise 8\n\nNOTE: The following exercise is inspired by a similar exercise by Albert Kim, a `fivethirtyeight` package co-author.\n\nThe plot in Exercise 7 illustrates that more of the films in our dataset are more recent, but it's not easy to examine the breakdown of the Bechdel test in each 5-year period. To that end, return to the fivethirtyeight.com article (linked above and in the codebook) and examine the plot titled \"The Bechdel Test Over Time\".\n\n## Part a\n\nSummarize the trends captured by this plot. (How has the representation of women in movies evolved over time?)\n\n::: {.callout-note title=\"Answer\"}\n\nOver time, there has been a notable increase in the number of films passing the Bechdel test. This indicates a gradual improvement in the representation of women in film. However, alongside this positive trend, there has also been a rise in films that fail to feature women in significant roles and/or that do not feature women speaking with each other about topics unrelated to men. This suggests that while some progress has been made, there remain significant challenges in achieving equitable representation, as many films still perpetuate stereotypes or overlook female narratives altogether.\n\n:::\n\n\\\n\\\n\n## Part b\n\nRecreate this plot from the article!
